2. **Most Affected Age Group**: The age group of 25-34 years has the highest attrition rate at 29.11%, indicating that this younger workforce might be more prone to leaving the organization.
3. **Under 25 Group Attrition**: Although the under 25 age group has a lower attrition rate (7.59%), it still reflects a noteworthy number of exits (38 employees). This might indicate the need for more engagement strategies.
4. **Job Satisfaction Insights**: Job satisfaction ratings show that certain roles, such as Sales Executives and Healthcare Representatives, have higher satisfaction, while Human Resources staff report lower satisfaction, which may point to dissatisfaction in the HR function.
5. **Department-Specific Insights**: R&D has the lowest attrition rate at 5.06%, while Sales and HR departments show a higher turnover. This difference suggests that R&D employees may be more satisfied or engaged.

### Recommendations
- **Retention Programs**: Design and implement retention programs focused on departments with higher attrition rates, particularly in Sales and HR.
- **Targeted Engagement for Younger Employees**: Since employees in the 25-34 age range show the highest turnover, initiatives like career development programs or mentoring might improve retention.
- **Improve Job Satisfaction in HR**: There is a notable low job satisfaction in HR roles. Addressing factors such as workload, support, and career growth opportunities can help reduce attrition in this department.
- **Invest in Career Development**: Especially for the younger age groups (under 25), providing career growth opportunities might help reduce early-stage attrition.

### Conclusion
This dashboard provides valuable insights into the organization's workforce, allowing HR departments to better understand employee dynamics and make data-driven decisions to improve retention, satisfaction, and workforce planning.
